# 📘 CA336 – Data Exploration Using Graph Theory

This repository contains all coursework submitted for **CA336: Data Exploration Using Graph Theory** during Semester 1, 2023/24 at DCU. The module focused on applying graph analytics and network theory using tools like **Neo4j** and **Cypher** to solve real-world problems.

## 🗂 Repo Structure
- `/lab_exam`  
  → Cypher-based lab assessment (20%)

- `/Graph Project`  
  → Graph analysis of international rugby using centrality & community detection

- `/NA_sports`  
  → American sports graph project focusing on graph search and traversal

## 📌 Projects Overview

### 🏉 `Graph Project` – International Rugby Graph Analysis
- Built a multi-relational graph from historic rugby match data (1871–present)
- Applied centrality metrics (degree, betweenness) to find the most influential teams
- Detected rivalries using community detection (Louvain & Label Propagation)

### 🏟 `NA_sports` – American Sports Graph Search
- Constructed a graph of US cities with Super Bowl wins and demographic tags
- Explored **Minimum Spanning Tree** and **Shortest Path** algorithms
- Investigated geographic and sporting relationships between major cities

### 🧪 `lab_exam`
- A standalone Cypher lab focused on practical query skills in Neo4j

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Neo4j** & Cypher query language
- **Python (Pandas)** for preprocessing
- **Graph Data Science Library** for advanced analytics
